I am a stupid biologist.
Everyday I come here doing nothing.
I just want to eat and sleep like my worms, or not.

Anyway, I am so sad now.
The exam I had this noon is like shit. The questions asked were not that hard, but I couldn't answer them directly and properly.

Maybe it's because I am too stupid. I don't think this has anything to do with the language. Even they asked me the same questions in Chinese, the result would be the same.
What I thought is about the education and training difference between Western and Asian.
